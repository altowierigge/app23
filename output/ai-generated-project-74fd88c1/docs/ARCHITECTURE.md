# System Architecture

## Backend Architecture


TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE: Full-Stack Social Media Platform

BACKEND ARCHITECTURE:
- FastAPI framework for high-performance REST API
- PostgreSQL database with optimized social graph schema
- Redis for caching and real-time features
- JWT authentication with refresh tokens
- WebSocket connections for real-time updates
- Celery for background tasks (notifications, image processing)
- AWS S3 for media storage
- Docker containerization

FRONTEND ARCHITECTURE:
- React 18 with TypeScript for type safety
- Redux Toolkit for state management
- React Query for server state and caching
- Socket.io for real-time features
- Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- PWA capabilities for mobile experience
- Lazy loading and code splitting for performance

DATABASE DESIGN:
- Users table with profiles and settings
- Posts table with content and metadata
- Relationships table for following/followers
- Likes and Comments tables with optimized indexes
- Notifications table with real-time triggers
- Messages table for direct messaging
        

## Frontend Architecture

No frontend plan available

## Integration Points

The backend and frontend communicate via RESTful API endpoints. Key integration considerations:

1. Authentication and authorization
2. Data validation and serialization
3. Error handling and user feedback
4. Real-time updates (if applicable)

## Deployment Architecture

The system is designed to be deployed using Docker containers with the following components:

- Backend API server
- Frontend web server
- Database (PostgreSQL/MySQL)
- Reverse proxy (Nginx)

## Security Considerations

- API authentication using JWT tokens
- Input validation on all endpoints
- CORS configuration for frontend access
- Environment-based configuration management
