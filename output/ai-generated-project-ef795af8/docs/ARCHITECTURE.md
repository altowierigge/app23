# System Architecture

## Backend Architecture

None

## Frontend Architecture

No frontend plan available

## Integration Points

The backend and frontend communicate via RESTful API endpoints. Key integration considerations:

1. Authentication and authorization
2. Data validation and serialization
3. Error handling and user feedback
4. Real-time updates (if applicable)

## Deployment Architecture

The system is designed to be deployed using Docker containers with the following components:

- Backend API server
- Frontend web server
- Database (PostgreSQL/MySQL)
- Reverse proxy (Nginx)

## Security Considerations

- API authentication using JWT tokens
- Input validation on all endpoints
- CORS configuration for frontend access
- Environment-based configuration management
