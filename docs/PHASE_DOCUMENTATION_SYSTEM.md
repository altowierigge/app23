   - **Creates comprehensive plan file** with:
     - Technology stack and patterns
     - Component specifications
     - Implementation guidance
     - Quality requirements

3. **Micro-Phase Planning**:
   - **Enhanced prompt** includes architecture plan file
   - **Updates plan file** with detailed micro-phase specs
   - Each micro-phase gets specific implementation guidance

4. **Implementation Phases**:
   - **Enhanced prompts** include:
     - Plan file specifications
     - Previous phase documentation
     - Architecture constraints
     - Coding standards
   - **Consistent implementation** following plan file

5. **Validation Phases**:
   - **Enhanced prompts** include acceptance criteria from plan file
   - **Quality validation** against architecture standards

## **🎯 Usage Examples**

### **View Architecture Plan:**
```bash
# Architecture plan file location
cat /tmp/ai_orchestrator_docs/plans/abc123_architecture_plan.yaml

# View implementation guide for specific phase
grep -A 20 "phase_1" /tmp/ai_orchestrator_docs/plans/abc123_architecture_plan.yaml
```

### **Check Phase Documentation:**
```bash
# View all phase docs for session
ls /tmp/ai_orchestrator_docs/phases/abc123_*

# Read specific phase documentation  
cat /tmp/ai_orchestrator_docs/phases/abc123_architecture_*.json | jq '.summary'
```

### **Project Summary:**
```bash
# Complete project overview
cat /tmp/ai_orchestrator_docs/summaries/abc123_project_summary.md
```

## **🔄 Integration with Caching**

The documentation system is fully integrated with caching:
- **Plan files are cached** for fast retrieval
- **Phase documentation is cached** to avoid regeneration
- **Enhanced prompts reference cached plan files**
- **Recovery uses both cached code and documentation**

This creates a powerful combination where the system can recover not just the code, but also the complete context and reasoning behind every decision! 🎯
