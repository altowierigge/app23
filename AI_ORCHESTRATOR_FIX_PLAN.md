# AI Orchestrator Complete Fix Plan

## Overview
The AI Orchestrator should be able to generate ANY type of application based on user requests, not just web apps with authentication/CRUD. This plan details how to fix the system to achieve true flexibility.

## Current Problems
1. **Rigid Workflow**: Forces every project through same phases (auth, CRUD, database)
2. **Template-Based**: Uses templates instead of true AI generation
3. **Limited to Web Apps**: Can't generate games, CLI tools, scripts, etc.
4. **Wasted AI Potential**: Agents constrained to specific roles

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Create Adaptive Workflow System

#### 1.1 Create `ai_orchestrator/core/adaptive_workflow.py`
```python
"""
Dynamic workflow generator that creates custom workflows based on project type.
"""
class AdaptiveWorkflowGenerator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.gpt_manager = GPTManagerAgent()
        
    async def analyze_project_request(self, user_request: str) -> ProjectAnalysis:
        """Use GPT Manager to understand project requirements"""
        # Analyze what type of project
        # Identify required components
        # Suggest tech stack
        # Generate custom phases
        
    async def generate_workflow_phases(self, analysis: ProjectAnalysis) -> List[WorkflowPhase]:
        """Create dynamic phases based on project needs"""
        # No hardcoded phases
        # Phases created based on project type
        # Support for any project structure
```

#### 1.2 Create `ai_orchestrator/core/project_analyzer.py`
```python
"""
Smart project analyzer that understands any project type.
"""
class ProjectAnalyzer:
    async def analyze(self, user_request: str) -> Dict:
        """
        Returns:
        - project_type: "web_app", "cli_tool", "game", "api", "script", etc.
        - components: List of required components
        - tech_stack: Recommended technologies
        - architecture: Suggested structure
        - custom_phases: Project-specific workflow phases
        """
```

### Phase 2: Update Agent System

#### 2.1 Update `ai_orchestrator/agents/base_agent.py`
- Remove hardcoded prompts about web apps
- Add dynamic prompt generation based on project type
- Support multiple programming languages

#### 2.2 Update `ai_orchestrator/agents/gpt_manager_agent.py`
New system prompt:
```
You are an AI Project Manager capable of understanding and planning ANY type of software project:
- Web applications (React, Vue, Django, Rails, etc.)
- CLI tools (Python, Rust, Go, etc.)
- Games (Unity, Pygame, JavaScript, etc.)
- Mobile apps (React Native, Flutter, etc.)
- APIs and microservices
- Data processing scripts
- Machine learning projects
- Browser extensions
- Discord/Telegram bots
- And any other software project

Your role is to:
1. Understand what the user wants to build
2. Identify the best approach and tech stack
3. Plan the project structure
4. Guide other agents in implementation
```

#### 2.3 Update `ai_orchestrator/agents/claude_agent.py`
New system prompt:
```
You are an AI Software Developer capable of implementing ANY type of software in ANY language:
- You adapt to the project requirements
- You write actual, working code (not templates)
- You follow best practices for the chosen tech stack
- You create complete, functional applications
```

### Phase 3: Modify Workflow Engine

#### 3.1 Update `ai_orchestrator/core/workflow_engine.py`
```python
class DynamicWorkflowEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.adaptive_generator = AdaptiveWorkflowGenerator()
        
    async def create_workflow(self, user_request: str) -> Workflow:
        """Create custom workflow for any project type"""
        # No YAML files
        # Dynamic phase generation
        # Flexible execution order
        
    async def execute_adaptive_workflow(self, workflow: Workflow):
        """Execute dynamically generated workflow"""
        # Support any number of phases
        # Allow parallel execution
        # No hardcoded dependencies
```

### Phase 4: Implementation Examples

2. **Create Adaptive Workflow Generator**
   - File: `ai_orchestrator/core/adaptive_workflow.py`
   - Generates custom phases
   - No templates or rigid structure
   - Uses AI to plan workflow

3. **Update Agent Prompts**
   - Files: All agent files in `ai_orchestrator/agents/`
   - Remove web-app specific prompts
   - Add flexible, adaptive prompts
   - Support all project types

4. **Modify Workflow Engine**
   - File: `ai_orchestrator/core/workflow_engine.py`
   - Support dynamic workflows
   - Remove YAML dependency

   - Remove hardcoded phases

### Phase 6: Testing Strategy

Test with diverse project types:
1. "Build a Python script to scrape websites"
2. "Create a REST API for a todo app using FastAPI"
3. "Make a terminal-based chess game in C++"
4. "Build a Chrome extension for taking notes"
5. "Create a data visualization dashboard with D3.js"
6. "Make a Telegram bot for weather updates"
7. "Build a machine learning model for image classification"

### Phase 7: Success Criteria

The system is successful when:
- ✅ Can generate ANY type of software project
- ✅ No hardcoded workflows or phases
- ✅ Agents adapt to project requirements
- ✅ Generates actual working code
- ✅ Supports multiple languages/frameworks
- ✅ Creates appropriate project structure
- ✅ Includes tests and documentation

### Phase 8: Cleanup

1. Remove `ai_orchestrator/core/universal_generator.py`
2. Remove `ai_orchestrator/core/code_generator.py` (if template-based)
3. Remove template files
4. Update web UI to support dynamic project creation

## Execution Instructions for Claude Sonnet

1. Start with Phase 1: Create the adaptive workflow system
2. Test each component as you build it
3. Ensure backward compatibility with existing projects
4. Focus on flexibility over rigid structure
5. Make agents truly intelligent, not template followers
6. Generate real, working code for any project type
7. Document all changes clearly

## Expected Outcome

Users can request ANY type of software and get a complete, working implementation:
- "Build a blockchain explorer"
- "Create a voice assistant"
- "Make a PDF generator library"
- "Build a multiplayer card game"
- "Create a Jenkins plugin"
- "Make a Kubernetes operator"
- Literally ANYTHING software-related!

The AI agents will understand, plan, and implement the complete solution without being constrained by templates or rigid workflows.
